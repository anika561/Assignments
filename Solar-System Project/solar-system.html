            <h4>Mercury</h4><br>
            <p>
               This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.
               Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation.
               A year on Mercury goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around.

               <h4>Venus</h4><br>
               Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.
               And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once.
               It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the sun.

                  <h4>Earth</h4>
                    Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet.
                    It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more.
                    Earth is special because it is an ocean planet.
                    Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.

                  <h4>Mars</h4>
                    Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
                    There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds.

                  <h4>Jupiter</h4>
                    Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface.

               <h4>Saturn</h4>
                Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.

               <h4>Uranus</h4>
                Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark.

               <h4>Neptune</h4>
                Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center.
